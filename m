After having a bitter disagreement with his friend and manager Jehangir 
Khan about the latter's blatant abuse of power and influence to win a dance 
competition called "Dance Dil Se" for his team JDC (Jehangir Dance 
Company), the choreographer of the dance company, Vishnu, quits his job. At 
first he wants to return home to Chennai, but his friend Gopi asks him to 
stay in Mumbai with him. Vishnu observes several young men using parkour to 
evade the police. They turn out to be proteges of Gopi, but despite their 
obvious raw talent, they lack the discipline required to become serious 
artists; they demonstrate this disastrously at a local event for a 
politician, wherein they set the stage on fire. After witnessing the 
youngsters showing their dancing abilities at Ganpati Chaturthi against 
their equally talented rival neighborhood, Vishnu decides to start his own 
dance group with them ultimately preparing them to compete in "Dance Dil 
Se". However, the lack of discipline among the dancers and rivalry between 
the two factions in the group led by D (Dharmesh Yelande) and Rocky (Salman 
Yusuff Khan) leads to multiple creative and emotional blocks. Initially, 
only Rocky and his gang are willing to attend the free classes, but soon D 
and his friends gravitate towards the studio.

The crew head to Dance Dil Se and audition, but when Rocky and D fight 
onstage for Rhea, their chances of appearing on the show in the first place 
seems bleak. Jehangir, in a bid to humiliate Vishnu publicly, persuades the 
judges to take the "Dhongri Dance Revolution" crew on as the shows 
"jokers". Faced with ridicule and the idea that they are a joke and not 
true dancers, Vishnu asks Rocky and D to do a step that requires a great 
deal of trust from both, but they cannot muster the trust to manage it. 
Vishnu has them choose the people they would trust to perform the step 
with, but then tricks both dancers by blindfolding them and having them 
attempt it again; this time, they are successful. Vishnu then states that 
unless the two manage to do the step without blindfolds none of the dancers 
would be allowed to go home for the night. Several abortive and 
unsuccessful attempts later D and Rocky take a break and Chandu talks to D 
and tells him about Bhavana's secret love for D. Bhavana and D get 
together, D completes the move successfully with Rocky, and the two 
factions begin to trust each other and work together. They even perform a 
dance act full of comedy dressed as jokers to answer back Jehangir's 
comment. The community complains that their children should not be mixing 
in such a way and through an impromptu dance performance are the youth able 
to convince their families about the importance of their talent. However, 
D's conservative and orthodox father refused to accept that his son desires 
to be a dancer.

The writer/lead singer Ivan Doroschuk has explained that "The Safety Dance" 
is a protest against bouncers prohibiting dancers from pogoing to 1980s new 
wave music in clubs when disco was declining and new wave was coming in. 
Unlike disco dancing, which is done with partners, new wave dancing is done 
individually and involves holding the torso rigid while thrashing about; 
pogoing involves jumping up and down (the more deliberately violent 
evolution of pogoing is slamdancing). Clubgoers doing the newer pogo dance 
were perceived as posing a danger to disco dancers on the dance floor, and 
so club bouncers would tell pogoers to stop or be kicked out of the club. 
Thus, the song is a protest and a call for freedom of expression.[8]

The song is performed in "Dream On", a first-season episode of the TV 
series *Glee*. In the episode, wheelchair user Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) 
fantasizes about being able to dance and leading a flash mob performance of 
the song in a shopping mall.[46] Ivan Doroschuk credited this version with 
"reaching a whole other section of people" to appreciate the song.[8]

He is one of India's most well-known dancers and choreographers and a 
director and producer; Prabhu Deva has mostly worked in the Tamil, Telugu, 
and Hindi cinema industries. With his amazing dancing style and infamous 
tunes dating back to the 1990s, the acclaimed dance instructor has won 
millions of hearts. Song scenes in movies like Pukar's "Que Sera Sera," 
"Muqabala," "Oorvasi Oorvasi," and "Wanted" are examples of this. Even 
though he's most known for his work in the Bollywood style of dancing, he 
has also studied Indian classical dance.
