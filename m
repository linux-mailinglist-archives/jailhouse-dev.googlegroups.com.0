Golden Teacher Effects
Like other cubensis strains, golden teachers=E2=80=99 primary active ingred=
ient is=20
psilocybin. The body breaks this chemical down into psilocin, which acts on=
=20
serotonin receptors to produce its psychedelic effects. It usually takes=20
around 30=E2=80=9360 minutes for the effects to begin, although they can st=
art=20
after as little as 10=E2=80=9320 minutes

https://t.me/psystoreoeg

In general, these effects include alterations in mood, sensations, and=20
perception. Some people experience visual effects, such as enhanced colors=
=20
or shifting geometric patterns. However, visual effects are reported less=
=20
frequently with golden teachers than with some other mushroom varieties.=20
Most users describe an insightful and spiritual journey, which aligns with=
=20
the =E2=80=9Cteacher=E2=80=9D part of their name.

https://t.me/psystoreoeg

Anecdotal reports suggest that side effects such as anxiety and paranoia=20
rarely occur with golden teachers. Furthermore, some state that the overall=
=20
experience is shorter than average, sometimes lasting just 2=E2=80=934 hour=
s. For=20
these reasons, golden teachers are sometimes considered an ideal choice for=
=20
those new to the world of psychedelics.

https://t.me/psystoreoeg

Of course, other factors also play a crucial role, such as one=E2=80=99s mi=
ndset,=20
expectations, and environment. Dosage also has a significant impact on the=
=20
overall experience. Therefore, it is essential to understand golden=20
teachers=E2=80=99 potency and prepare adequately before ingestion.

https://t.me/psystoreoeg

Golden Teacher Mushrooms Potency
Mushrooms are a natural product and can vary significantly in potency from=
=20
one specimen to the next. Therefore, it isn=E2=80=99t easy to give an accur=
ate=20
figure.

https://t.me/psystoreoeg

However, golden teacher mushrooms=E2=80=99 potency is generally considered =
moderate=20
compared to other cubensis strains. For example, strains like penis envy=20
and tidal wave are known for being much stronge

https://t.me/psystoreoeg

In terms of psilocybin content, a 2021 review estimated that 1 gram of=20
dried mushrooms contains approximately 10mg of psilocybin. However, the=20
publication did not specify whether this figure applies to Psilocybe=20
cubensis or another species.

https://t.me/psystoreoeg

Golden Teacher Mushrooms Dosage
There is no standard golden teacher mushrooms dosage because everybody=20
responds differently. Also, as we mentioned, there can be significant=20
variations in potency from one mushroom to the next. Myriad factors can=20
also affect the experience, with dosage being just one part of the equation=
.

https://t.me/psystoreoeg


Anyone inexperienced with psychedelics should start at the lower end of the=
=20
scale to see how golden teacher mushrooms affect them before increasing in=
=20
dosage
