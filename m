Penis Envy magic mushrooms are three times more potent than other=20
mushrooms. The effects of Penis Envy magic mushrooms may come on quickly=20
due to higher levels of psilocin than psilocybin.
About Penis Envy
Penis Envy magic mushrooms can impact you differently based upon a variety=
=20
of factors, like your size, weight, your state of health, whether you have=
=20
taken them before, the amount you take, and more. The setting in which you=
=20
are taking them and who you are with are critical factors. Being in nature,=
=20
in a safe, calm and tranquil setting, with no pending pressures or=20
obligations is ideal for the user.=20

Trip Level 0: Microdosing
Recommended dosage: 0.2 =E2=80=93 0.5 g. dried mushrooms =E2=80=93 A micro-=
dose is a=20
sub-perceptual amount of mushrooms. Take this every 2-3 days to boost=20
creativity or feel less anxious. Microdosing trip levels capsules. Added as=
=20
level 0, it=E2=80=99s meant to be taken along with your day-to-day routine.
Trip Level 1: Happy go lucky
Recommended dosage: 0.8 =E2=80=93 1 g. dried mushrooms =E2=80=93 The effect=
s are mild and=20
similar to being high on weed. Music starts to feel better, strangers seem=
=20
more friendly and the mind is able to lose some control. You could have=20
mild visual enhancements or some sound distortion, but these will be subtle=
.
Trip Level 2: Beginner=E2=80=99s paradise
Recommended dosage: 1 =E2=80=93 1.5 g. dried mushrooms =E2=80=93 Consistent=
 sensorial=20
accentuation, colors becoming brighter and a light body high. Level 2 can=
=20
be a more intense form of Trip Level 1, but with the right dosage it can be=
=20
something more. Be prepared for the beginnings of visual and auditory=20
hallucinations: objects moving and coming to life along with geometrical=20
forms when you close your eyes. It will be harder to concentrate and=20
communicate and you will notice an increase in creativity along with an=20
enhanced sensation, lightness and euphoria.
Trip Level 3: Classic psychedelic trip
Recommended dosage: 1.5 =E2=80=93 3 g. dried mushrooms =E2=80=93 Trip Level=
 3 is great for=20
beginners who want to jump in the =E2=80=9Creal=E2=80=9D psychedelic experi=
ence, without=20
overdoing the dosage. This level is where visual hallucinations along with=
=20
the appearance of patterns and fractals will be evident. No more hinting or=
=20
subtle flashes of visuals, it=E2=80=99s happening for real. The surface of =
the=20
object you=E2=80=99re observing will become shiny and moving, as your field=
 of=20
depth is altered. Distortions in the aptitude to measure the passage of=20
time, might cause an 1 hour to feel like an eternity.
Level 4: Flying with the stars https:t.me/Ricko_swavy8
Recommended dosage: 3 =E2=80=93 4 g. dried mushrooms =E2=80=93 Strong hallu=
cinations take=20
over: a psychedelic flood of shapes, contours and colors will blend=20
together and hit the shores of your consciousness. There=E2=80=99s no stopp=
ing the=20
waves in Level 4. There will be some moments when you will lose touch=20
reality. Random, non-existent objects will appear and the concept of time=
=20
will fade away to the background. Intriguing to some, scary to others, this=
=20
is the level where psychedelics can really be powerful, life-altering and=
=20
mind expanding. Keep in mind that this dosage is only recommend for=20
experience users.
