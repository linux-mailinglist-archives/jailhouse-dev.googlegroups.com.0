Steve Perry joined Journey in 1977, replacing original singer Gregg Rolie. 
His powerful and distinctive voice helped the band achieve a new level of 
popularity and recognition. He also co-wrote most of the band's hits with 
Schon and Cain. Perry left Journey in 1987, after the release of their 
ninth studio album Raised on Radio, due to health issues and creative 
differences. He pursued a solo career, releasing two albums: Street Talk in 
1984 and For the Love of Strange Medicine in 1994. He also collaborated 
with other artists, such as Kenny Loggins, Randy Jackson and David Foster.
In 1996, Perry reunited with Journey for their tenth studio album Trial by 
Fire, which was a commercial and critical success. However, he suffered a 
hip injury that prevented him from touring with the band. In 1998, he was 
replaced by Steve Augeri, who sang with Journey until 2006. Perry has not 
performed with Journey since then, although he has expressed his 
appreciation and respect for the band and their fans. He released his third 
solo album Traces in 2018, after a long hiatus from music.
Journey's discography spans over four decades and includes 14 studio 
albums, four live albums, eight compilation albums and 59 singles. The band 
has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 and has 
received numerous awards and honors. Their music has been featured in 
various movies, TV shows, video games and musicals. They have also 
influenced many artists from different genres, such as Mariah Carey, Bon 
Jovi, Metallica and Glee.
