can take on a golden or caramel color, while the stem is usually thick and 
white.
Potency: Golden Teachers are considered moderately potent among psilocybin 
mushrooms. Their effects can vary depending on factors such as growing 
conditions, individual tolerance, and dosage. Users generally report a 
balance between visual and introspective effects.

Teacher mushrooms can lead to altered states of consciousness characterized 
by visual and auditory hallucinations, changes in perception of time and 
space, introspection, and sometimes a sense of unity or connection with 
one's surroundings.

relatively straightforward cultivation process. They are known for being 
resilient
