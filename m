Recently, I've installed Windows 7 on an old HP 2000 Notebook. The OS runs 
fine, but the drivers for WAN Mini-port and Ethernet port aren't updated 
and don't allow me to connect to the Internet in any way through it.

I've tried finding drivers for it on my desktop, which I will then transfer 
to the laptop via USB, but I've had no luck finding any on the HP website. 
When I try to find drivers for my laptop's model, it says that there aren't 
any. I've had no luck anywhere either. If someone could link me to any 
downloads or knows anything I can do about this, it'd be greatly 
appreciated.
Hp 2000 Laptop Drivers For Windows 7 32 Bit

*Download File* https://shurll.com/2wIZXr


Thanks for ythe info. I managed to find the product code for the laptop, it 
is the HP2000 -2d01SI. I loaded the you Cam 5 application software and 
reset the cam settings to default. All is fine now!! Thanks. Skype is also 
full functioning now.

I have another problem battling wiyh the laptop to get it's bluetoot 
working. It cannot see or detect other blutooth devices enen if they made 
visible, etc. I tried to install every possible bluetooth driver from the 
list of drivers displayed at HP's website for this laptop (HP 2000-2d01SI) 
for win 7 32bit. I also loaded intel installation utility driver, chipset 
driver and SMBus driver to make sure, but no results. I tried also to load 
the dual Bluetooth/Wifi card driver for incase it has such one, but no 
luck. I do not want to open the laptop to see if I can find the Bluetooth 
chip and the model of it. I just want to mention that this laptop came pre- 
installed with Windows 8, 64bit, but as we know W8 it is a mess and so 
uninstalled it and loaded a real Win 7 32bit on it. May it be the problem? 
Al other functions on the laptop is working good and no problems. Just 
wonder if W10 will work on this laptop. Thanks for your help.

I tried everything now to get BT working. Followed your advice for MS 
updates, they found only a MS security essential download. Checked HP 
updates via "check now", but no lug. It just brings up a list of BT 
drivers. Good luck I saw the driver needed in Device manager under Bluetoot 
radios properties. It is the Qualcomm Artheros BT4.0 driver. I re-installed 
it from my laptop's driver page. I also checked the Power Management tab 
and unchecked the box that says "Allow the computer to turn off this device 
to save power." Remember I have win7, so I cannot do the option: "Step 1, 
Search for "Change device" in the Windows 8 Start menu.......etc"
