ion, leading to visual, auditory, and sensory distortions. Users may experi=
ence vivid and intensified colors, geometric patterns, trails, and enhanced=
 or distorted sounds.<br>Intense Emotional States: LSD can induce a wide ra=
nge of emotions, from euphoria and bliss to anxiety and confusion. Emotions=
 may fluctuate rapidly, and the intensity of emotions can be heightened.<br=
>Expanded Consciousness: Users often report a sense of interconnectedness a=
nd unity with the universe. They may experience a heightened awareness of t=
heir thoughts, emotions, and surroundings, along with a deepened sense of m=
eaning and spirituality.<br>Hallucinations: LSD can produce hallucinations,=
 which are perceptual experiences of objects or events that are not actuall=
y present. These hallucinations can be both visual and auditory.<br>Altered=
 Time and Space Perception: Users may perceive time as distorted, with minu=
tes feeling like hours or hours passing by quickly. The sense of space can =
also be altered, with a distorted perception of distance and size.<br>Minds=

able, safe environment are generally recommended to reduce the risk of a ne=
gative experience.<br>Risks and Side Effects:<br><br>While LSD is not consi=
